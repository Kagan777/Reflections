How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Well, this will narrow down my search for mistakes or changes to a specific lines,
instead of going throughout the whole code

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It will allow me to have access to any change made while debugging 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
You might forget to commit
